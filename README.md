MicroStar 2000 Encoder source code, version 2.0s

    Author:  Gordon Anderson

    The MicroStar 2000 is a model airplane encoder. An encoder reads
    the joy stick pots and the switches and generates the modulation
    signal sent to the RF deck, the other significant part of a
    transmitter.

    This project started in 2000 with the first software release in January
    of 2001.
